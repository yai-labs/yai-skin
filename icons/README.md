# Icons

Brand/source icon assets and generation helper scripts.

## Structure

- `master/`: source artwork used for generating derived assets.
- `generate-icons.sh`: local helper for generating icon outputs.

## Notes

- Keep generated artifacts out of this repository unless explicitly required.
- Preserve `master/` as the canonical source input.
